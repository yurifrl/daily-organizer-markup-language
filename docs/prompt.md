# Syntax Details

1. **Header**
   - **Format**: `# Day X | Start Time - End Time`
   - **Purpose**: Sets the day's identifier and the active time frame for scheduling tasks.

2. **Task Types**
   - **Flexible Task (`-`)**
     - **Format**: `- Task Description | Duration`
     - **Purpose**: Task without a fixed start time; fits into the next available slot. Duration can be specified in hours (`1h`) or Pomodoros (`p2` for two pomodoros).
   - **Fixed Task (`*`)**
     - **Format**: `* Task Description | Time Range`
     - **Purpose**: Task scheduled for a specific time. Time range can be start to end (`10:00 - 11:00`) or a single start time implying a default duration of one Pomodoro.
   - **Reminder (`!`)**
     - **Format**: `! Reminder Description | Time`
     - **Purpose**: Triggers a notification at a specified time; does not occupy time in the schedule.
   - **Recurrent Task (`&`)**
     - **Format**: `& Task Description | Frequency`
     - **Purpose**: Repeats regularly throughout the day. Frequency format specifies interval and start time (e.g., `every 6h starting at 09:00`).

# Example Input and Output

## Input:
```
# Day 1 | 08:00 - 18:00

- Review Emails | p2
* Team Meeting | 10:00 - 11:00
! Drink Water | 07:00
& Go for a Walk | every 6h starting at 09:00
```

## Output:
```
08:00 to 08:50    - Review Emails.

14:30             - Drink Water.
15:00 to 15:05    - Go for a Walk.
```

## Output Interpretation:
- **08:00 to 08:50** - Review Emails (occupies 2 pomodoros, or 50 minutes starting at the first available time).
- **09:00 to 09:05** - Go for a Walk (first occurrence based on recurrence rule).
- **10:00 to 11:00** - Team Meeting (fixed time).
- **14:30** - Drink Water (reminder).
- **15:00 to 15:05** - Go for a Walk (second occurrence based on recurrence rule).

This specification allows for clear, actionable scheduling based on straightforward rules and syntax, ensuring tasks are accurately placed and managed within the daily timeline.
